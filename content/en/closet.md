TRANSforming the valley invites you to our Trans & Queer Community Closet event, a no-cost fashion sharing program for members of the LGBTQIA2S+ community. Join us to explore new fashion styles with our volunteers, take home the pieces you like, reduce fashion and textile waste, and learn more about TRANSforming the Valley's programs under the [Chippewa Valley LGBTQ+ Community Center](https://www.cvlgbt.org/).

This event and the articles you take home are provided free of charge for anyone who identifies as a member of the LBGTQIA2S+ community. Monetary donations to the [CVLGBTQ+ Community Center](https://www.cvlgbt.org/) are graciously appreciated but never required.

We have a wide variety of masculine and feminine clothing and accessories curated by TRANSforming the Valley volunteers. A selection of personal care products are also available.

## This is the last event in the Closet's current form!

String Theory Studio in Chippewa Falls, the host of the Closet, is closing its doors at the end of January. We cannot thank the team at String Theory enough for their contributions to Transforming the Valley and the Closet over the years.

Because of this change in host, this may be the final Closet event for some time. We are still figuring out what to do with the Closet's current stock and how to continue to provide this valuable service to the Chippewa Valley. Future events will be announced on this page, CVLGBT's email newsletter, on the CVLGBTQ Community Center's Discord server, and other CVLGBTQ channels.

We are not currently accepting clothing donations due to this change.

If you'd like to contact us about the event, please email [chair@transformingthevalley.org](mailto:chair@transformingthevalley.org) or join the CVLGBTQ Community Center's Discord server using the link at [cvlgbt.org](https://cvlgbt.org).

## When

Our final event at String Theory is scheduled for January 24th and 25th, 2026.

On January 24, the event runs from 2PM to 7PM.

On January 25, the event runs from 10AM until 2PM.

We will pack up the Closet's stock and transport it elsewhere after the event concludes. We will need additional volunteer help in Chippewa Falls and again in Eau Claire to move the stock to and from the truck.
