TRANSforming the valley invites you to our Trans & Queer Community Closet event, a no-cost fashion sharing program for members of the LGBTQIA2S+ community. Join us to explore new fashion styles with our volunteers, take home the pieces you like, reduce fashion and textile waste, and learn more about TRANSforming the Valley's programs under the [Chippewa Valley LGBTQ+ Community Center](https://www.cvlgbt.org/).

This event and the articles you take home are provided free of charge for anyone who identifies as a member of the LBGTQIA2S+ community. Monetary donations to the [CVLGBTQ+ Community Center](https://www.cvlgbt.org/) are graciously appreciated but never required.

We have a wide variety of masculine and feminine clothing and accessories curated by TRANSforming the Valley volunteers. A selection of personal care products are also available.
