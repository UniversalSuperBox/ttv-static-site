Thank you for your interest in donating to Transforming the Valley. Your support helps us serve transgender, nonbinary, and gender-spicy people in the Chippewa Valley.

## Donate monetarily

Monetary donations given via this link are placed in the CVLGBTQ+ general fund for use in TTV and other Community Center programs as needed. Thank you again!

## Closet donations

The [Free & Queer Community Closet]({{< ref "/closet" >}}) relies on community donations for its continued success. We help people of all shapes and sizes be confident in their desired presentation, so we need a diverse selection of articles available. These guidelines can help you select and organize your donation to make the most impact.

### What we do with your donation

Once we receive your donated articles, we perform a quality check on all items and reject items according to our guidelines. Then, we sort, hang, and display all accepted items. Accepted articles quickly end up in the Closet's inventory, so you should see your donation as part of our next event!

### Donate clothing & accessories

We accept many articles of lightly-used clothing and accessories. The guidelines in this section apply to all donations. Those which apply to masculine or feminine articles are listed below in separate sections.

Please wash and thoroughly dry your donation. We do not currently have the facilities or volunteers to wash every donation, which may cause us to reject items we would otherwise add to our inventory. The event space we use at String Theory is used for other clients, so we put our inventory into storage between events.

The Closet is an event which primarily serves adults, young adults, and teenagers. We also primarily serve trans, nonbinary, and gender-spicy individuals. This presents some interesting sizing challenges. Articles which stray outside these size boundaries are generally rejected. More information on desired sizing for "different sides of the store" are provided below.

We **always reject** articles which meet any of the following criteria:

* Items with strong unpleasant odors, secondhand smoke
* Items with stains and/or other visible discoloration
* Items with rips, tears, and/or holes (unless that's part of the style)
* Articles with printed or embroidered imagery/logos (unless they're incredibly funny *and* in exceptionally good condition)
* Fast Fashion brands such as Shein and Temu.

For **undergarments**, we only accept sealed, unused underwear. Bras, swimwear, and gender-affirming clothing are all acceptable according to our normal guidelines.

We accept **cold-weather gear** (jackets and coats) according to our normal guidelines.

Donated **formalwear** (including formal dresses, suits, and pants) is shared between TTV's Closet event and CVLGBT's Queer Prom event, but stays under normal guidelines.

#### Masculine clothing

Masculine clothing tends to be kept longer and worn more often than feminine clothing, so we don't see as many donations of it. Therefore, our acceptance criteria is wider.

##### Sizing

All sizes starting at Youth Large are accepted.

Men's **Big and Tall** sizes are in short supply and always appreciated by our stout and lanky clients alike.

Pants and shorts start at a 26" waist (Men's pants sizing is great, why doesn't everyone do that?)

Shoe sizes from Men's 6 up to and including Men's 13 are accepted. Both wide and narrow sizes are always helpful.

##### Style

We love to send people home with flannels and other plaid shirts. Otherwise, it's hard to go wrong in masculine clothing. Almost everything which passes the "always reject" test ends up in the Closet.

If you really need a style guide to go off of, anything that you could see worn by Adam Sandler's character in Big Daddy will probably be appreciated.

#### Feminine clothing

The number of donated feminine articles far outpaces masculine articles for us, so our acceptance criteria is more narrow.

##### Sizing

Feminine sizing depends greatly on the clothing label, so giving any size recommendation is a fool's errand. Keep in mind that we generally serve people with wider ribcages and upper arms than popular brands provide in common sizes.

**Plus sized** items are always appreciated. Items from Westwind in particular are always kept unless they meet any "always reject" criteria.

**Junior** sizes are almost always rejected.

Shoe sizes starting at Women's 10 are accepted. Wide sizes are highly desirable.

##### Style

Size rather than style tends to count for our feminine population, but we do look for a few criteria in particular. Fits which work for people with wider ribcages, smaller busts, and wider arms are well-loved. Skirts and dresses *do* go spinny. When they have pockets, they elicit the response you'd expect.

Items of lower quality are put under more scrutiny than those which are built to last.

These guidelines are not law, of course: we see people with all body shapes and sizes and all tastes in fashion.

### Donate cosmetics & toiletries

Cosmetics and toiletries are accepted if they are brand new and sealed.

Unopened hypoallergenic cosmetics are practically worth their weight in gold to us, and we will always graciously accept them.

### How to donate

Donations are accepted at [the Chippewa Valley LGBTQ+ Community Center](https://www.cvlgbt.org/) during drop-in hours which are listed on our linked homepage. If you need to schedule an alternative time for donations, or you have other questions, please use the contact information on [cvlgbt.org](https://www.cvlgbt.org/).

While your donated articles are made available at no charge to our clients, the fair-market value of the goods still apply for the donation. All donations are eligible for a written donation receipt. We are required to provide a receipt if the fair-market value of the entire donation is at or above $200. To assess the fair-market value of your donation, you can use a value guide such as [Hope Village Gems'](https://www.hopevillagems.org/how-can-you-help/thrift-store/donation-value-guide/) or [Goodwill of Northern New England](https://goodwillnne.org/donate/donation-value-guide/). For other questions on the value of your donation, please consult a tax professional who can provide better guidance for your situation.

CVLGBTQ+ is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, EIN 52-2292725. Most clothing, accessory, cosmetics, and toiletry donations are tax-deductible. No goods or services will be provided in exchange for your donation.

### What we do with rejected items

Items which do not meet our guidelines but are still saleable on a thrift store rack are donated on to [AbleLight Thrift Shop on London Road in Eau Claire](https://ablelight.org/thrift-stores/eau-claire/) so they do not go to waste and help another amazing cause. Items which cannot be accepted by TTV or AbleLight are provided as scrap fabric at our events. Due to space constraints, we must unfortunately dispose of overflow scrap fabric through landfill waste.
